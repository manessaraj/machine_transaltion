# Introduction
In this notebook, A deep neural network is built that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. Completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation. This project is done as part of Udacitys NLP nanodegree, thanks Udacity for opportunity to learn NLP!

# Setup

This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently. Support is available to use either of the following two methods for accessing GPU-enabled cloud computing resources.
